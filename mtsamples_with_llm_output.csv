0, A 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies., Allergy / Immunology, Allergic Rhinitis ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well.","allergy / immunology, allergic rhinitis, allergies, asthma, nasal sprays, rhinitis, nasal, erythematous, allegra, sprays, allergic,","- Analytical Result:
  - The patient, a 23-year-old white female, is experiencing symptoms of allergic rhinitis, which appear to have worsened since her relocation. She has tried multiple over-the-counter antihistamines (Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra) without significant improvement. She has also used over-the-counter nasal sprays, but no prescription ones. Her medical history includes asthma, though it is currently not requiring daily medication and does not seem to be flaring up. Currently, she is only on Ortho Tri-Cyclen and Allegra. The physical examination revealed mildly erythematous throat, swollen and erythematous nasal mucosa with clear drainage, and clear tympanic membranes. Lungs were clear, and she had no cervical adenopathy.

- Insight & Findings:
  - The patient's allergy symptoms, such as nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchiness, have not improved with previous antihistamine use, indicating possible antihistamine tolerance or ineffectiveness. The patient's history of allergies worsening after moving suggests environmental triggers specific to her new location. The decision to switch to Zyrtec or consider loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, may address this issue, as they have a different mechanism of action and are less likely to cause tolerance. The addition of a nasal corticosteroid like Nasonex could help manage both nasal congestion and inflammation more effectively.

- Recommendations:
  1. Switch antihistamine: Encourage the patient to try Zyrtec instead of Allegra for three weeks, considering her previous experience with short-term effectiveness. Alternatively, prescribe loratadine as a cost-effective and less sedating option if Allegra remains ineffective.
  2. Nasal corticosteroid: Prescribe Nasonex (mometasone furoate) nasal spray, two sprays in each nostril daily, for three weeks to help reduce nasal inflammation and congestion. Provide a prescription for continued use if symptoms improve.
  3. Environmental assessment: Recommend that the patient consult an allergist for further evaluation of potential environmental triggers in her new location, such as pollen, mold, or dust mites, to identify avoidance strategies and consider allergen immunotherapy if indicated.
  4. Asthma monitoring: Continue monitoring her asthma symptoms, as allergic rhinitis can sometimes exacerbate asthma control. Encourage the patient to communicate any changes in her respiratory symptoms promptly.
  5. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in three weeks to reassess symptoms, evaluate the effectiveness of the new medications, and make further adjustments to the treatment plan if necessary."
